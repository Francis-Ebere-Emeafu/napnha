                                                        The National Association of President’s NYSC Honours Awardees (NAPNHA) is the umbrella body of former NYSC corps members who received the prestigious award for their distinguished, patriotic and selfless contribution to the nation during the national youth service. This award is conferred by the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Federal Republic of Nigeria.
<br>
<br>
Since inception of the President’s NYSC Honours Award in the year 1974, the number of award recipients has grown progressively. Members of our association include teachers, educationists,  medical doctors, lawyers, engineers, artists, scientists etc who work in the private sector and in the public sector as senior and very senior federal civil servants in different states of Nigeria and in the Federal Capital Territory. Furthermore, some of our members constitute part of a highly skilled work force in various continents of the world while others are post graduate students under Federal Government special scholarship program.
<br>
<br>
Over the years, NAPNHA has contributed to infrastructural, human capital and socio-economic development of Nigeria; we had donated wheel chairs to physically challenged Nigerians to mark World Disability Days, donated eye glasses, carried out free eye tests in collaboration with a Non-governmental organization. We had also donated food and other items to Internally Displaced Persons(IDPs) and to orphans at the Abuja Children’s Home. In addition, we had partnered with a Non-governmental Organization to create public awareness on road safety, just to mention but a few.
NAPNHA is a repository of highly skilled and knowledgeable experts who could be readily mobilised   and engaged  to execute projects in health, agriculture, infrastructure, charity, human resource development, information technology, education,  transportation, youth and women empowerment etc.
<br>
<br>
Our strength and distinguishing feature  lie in our geographical,  socio-cultural, ethnic and skill diversity. Ours is an association of persons of high integrity and versatility. We welcome fruitful and development oriented  partnership with individuals  and organizations of proven credibility and reputation. It is our conviction that working together with such entities would fast-track achievement of the sustainable development goals in Nigeria.
